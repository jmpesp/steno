//! Steno is an in-progress prototype based on distributed sagas.
//!
//! Sagas help organize execution of a set of asynchronous tasks that can fail,
//! providing useful semantics for unwinding the whole operation when that
//! happens.
//!
//! ## Getting started
//!
//! * Write some functions that will be used as _actions_ and _undo actions_ for
//!   your saga.  Package these into a [`SagaActionFunc`].
//! * Use [`SagaTemplateBuilder`] to build a graph of these actions.
//! * Use [`SagaExecutor`] to execute the saga.

/*
 * We disable the warning for unstable name collisions because we deliberately
 * have some conflicts in rust_features.rs (corresponding to backports of
 * unstable features).  If and when these features are stabilized, we should see
 * warnings that our backported versions are unused and we can remove them.

 * TODO-design TODO-correctness TODO-robustness In a lot of places, we've
 * assumed that the caller should always know what type a node output or error
 * is, and that's fine -- except for the fact that this might be coming in off
 * the wire and something else may have corrupted it.  Maybe we should treat
 * these as explicit operational errors that always bubble up and cause
 * execution of the saga to fail with a generic-type error.
